# SPARKY Source Code

### Introduction
The SPARKY project uses ESP32 Arduino Libraries. Compiling requires VSCode with the Platformio IDE extension and Espressif 32 board platform. It is not intended to 
be compiled with the Arduino IDE.
All the software source files are provided so you can make changes. 

Please do NOT create a GitHub issue ticket if you have technical questions or seek advice. The place for 
that is at the official project discussion area found at the rc-cam.com forum:

### config.h
The entries in the config.h file are provide so you can personalize common default settings.

### The Fine Print
The source files can be modified to customize it to your application. It is not intended for coding beginners; 
If your Cpp coding experience is limited then start with a simpler project. There are many Arduino forums and 
YouTube instructional videos that will help get you going.

### Platformio
The project successfully compiles on Visual Studio Code Version 1.39.2 with Platformio IDE 1.9.0, and Espressif32 1.11.0 board platform. All required files are provided, including important library dependencies.

### Source Code Formatting
All .cpp and .h files have been formatted with the Uncrustify extension. The uncrustify.cfg file is included in the file package.

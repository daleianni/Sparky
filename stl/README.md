# SPARKY 3D Printed Parts

### STL Files
All 3D printed parts are designed to fit the ZX7-200 "minGB" IGBT Inverter Welder. They will not fit other ZX7-200 brands.
ABS plastic is recommended. The STL files must be re-scaled to account for material shrinkage; 101% works well for typical ABS filament.

### Assembly
Sparky is housed in two 3D printed parts. The Front Chassis holds the TFT, ESP32, and Perfboard assembly. 
Seven M2x6 self-tapping screws are used to hold these in place.

The Rear Chassis holds the two speakers and PAM8403 audio amplifier. Hot Melt glue is used to mount them.

The Front and Rear Chassis are held together by two self-tapping M2x10 screws. 
A 3D printed Clip slides into the slot at the far-end of the Rear Chassis. 
It locks the plastic housing to the metal cabinet. A single M2x12 screw holds it in place.

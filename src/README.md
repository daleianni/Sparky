# SPARKY Source Code

### Introduction
The SPARKY project uses ESP32 Arduino Libraries. Compiling requires VSCode with the Platformio IDE extension and Espressif32 board platform. It is not intended to be compiled with the Arduino IDE. All the software source files are provided so you can make changes. 

Please do NOT create a GitHub issue ticket if you have technical questions or seek advice. The place for 
that is at the official project discussion area found at the rc-cam.com forum:

### config.h
The entries in the config.h file are provide so you can personalize common default settings.

### The Fine Print
This project's software is intended for programmers with moderate or higher coding skills. Beginners should start with a simpler project; There are many Arduino forums and YouTube instructional videos that will help with the learning process.

### Platformio
The project successfully compiles on Visual Studio Code Version 1.39.2 with Platformio IDE 1.9.0, and platform-espressif32
board platform (development release Oct-28-2019 or higher). It might compile with a stable release version higher than 1.11.0. 

### Project Files
All required files are provided, including any special library dependencies.

### Source Code Formatting
All .cpp and .h files have been formatted with the Uncrustify extension. The uncrustify.cfg file is included in the file package.

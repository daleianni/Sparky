# SPARKY Schematic Files
### Information:
The schematic set consists of two pages in common PDF format.

This project is suitable for most advanced electronic circuit builders that are familiar with high voltage safety.
Step-by-step wiring instructions and "Heathkit" type pictorial wiring diagrams are not provided. But 
basic build information is available in the project blog at:
https://www.rc-cam.com/forum/index.php?/topic/4605-sparky-a-little-stick-welder-with-big-features/

**WARNING:** An inverter welder is a potentially dangerous machine. Lethal primary voltages (>300 volts) are present inside the cabinet, even after power is turned off. 
The involved currents have more than enough energy to vaporize misplaced wiring (and misguided hand tools) in a dangerously hot explosive flash.
Proceed at your own risk.
